### Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

This project is intended for graph database extraction for further use with dedicated Python libraries for analysis Graph-Sub-Graph Isomorphism problem.

### Prerequisite <a name="prerequisite"></a>

Launching this application assume that you have installed on your computer a few required libraries and you use work station with Intel processor that support Math Kernel Library (MKL). In the parenthesis ared provdied recommend versions of those libraries on which project was tested.
- Armadillo Library (12.8)
- Boost Library (1.85.0)
- Intel MKL Library (2024.2)

### Database Description <a name="desc"></a>

Here should be located information about original database authors,
basic postulates and ftp server address from it is possible to download
all original files (it is recommended to add original address with domain
to those files).

### Instalation <a name="install"></a>

MKL Library installation instructions under Windows and citations 
about Armadillo library.

### Examples of use <a name="use"></a>

Python examples of code to resolve graph-sub-graph isomorphism problem
with local graph database.
